# Now let us consider a constant square footage of 2000 and let us consider 1 and 2 bedroom houses
# 1 bedroom house with 2000 sqft: price = -19.31500 + 0.12844*2000 + 15.19819*1 = 252.7632 thousand dollars
# 2 bedroom house with 2000 sqft: price = -19.31500 + 0.12844*2000 + 15.19819*2 = 267.9614 thousand dollars
# So the estimated price increase from a 1 bedroom price to a 2 bedroom, keeping sqrft constant is 15.1982 thousand dollars

# 1 bedroom house with 2000 sqft: price = -19.31500 + 0.12844*140 + 15.19819*1 = 13.86479 thousand dollars
# 2 bedroom house with 140 sqft: price = -19.31500 + 0.12844*140 + 15.19819*2 = 29.06298 thousand dollars
# So the estimated price increase from a 1 bedroom price to a 2 bedroom, with a sqrft of 140 is 15.19819 thousand dollars
# This is exactly similar to the answer in the second part

# From the model above, it is clear that about 63.19% of the variation in price is explained by the sqrft and number of bedrooms

# For a sqrft of 2438 and 4 bedroom house, the predicted selling price (price-hat) can be calculated from the OLS regression line using the following equation;
# price-hat = -19.31500 + 0.12844*2438 + 15.19819*4 = 354.6145 thousand dollars

# It is given that the selling price for the first house is $300,000(price = 300)
